0,Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID,5555,B0168YIWSI,"This keyboard is very easy to type on, but the fingerprint reader is the best feature. It is very accurate and simplifies login."
1,Boytone - 2500W 2.1-Ch. Home Theater System - Black Diamond,3236,"B018K251JE,B00VILQKQ8","It's small but boy is it LOUD. I love it, for the size and convince of it. Goes great on top shelves and fills the room nicely. Really great!"
2,Sanus VLF410B1 10-Inch Super Slim Full-Motion Mount for 37 - 84 Inches TV's,6839,B00C78VIUE,"This was the most flush to the wall full motion mount. So nice to move it around to access the wires etc. Bolts were a little long or too short that came with the kit for my 55"" Samsung (2015 model), so I had to cut the longest set with hack saw. One thing to mention make sure you have a recessed outlet so that the mount can be all the way against the wall. Those are about $9 and easy to install."
3,Ultimate Ears MEGABLAST Portable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Speaker with hands-free Amazon Alexa voice control (waterproof) - Graphite Black,8589,B075WKS4D8,Excellent product for college student and high school kids
4,Flipside 300 Backpack (Black),3404,B000YA33DC,"Pros:It has very good padding on all the sides, enough space for 1 camera and 3-4 lenses and speedlite flash and a pouch for accessories. I'm happy with its features. Cons:1. It doens't have space for laptop2. Straps are extendable so they are long, wish it had holders where the extra strap line can be secured."
5,Corsair CMSA8GX3M2A1066C7 Apple 8 GB Dual Channel Kit DDR3 1066 (PC3 8500) 204-Pin DDR3 Laptop SO-DIMM Memory 1.5V,4042,B00505EZYW,"The RAM works just as it should. When installed correctly, it starts working at the moment of startup. Very helpful in general multitasking and especially in video and image editing. This product was very helpful in making my computer run more efficiently."
6,iHome Rechargeable Splash Proof Stereo Bluetooth Speaker - Black (IBT33BC),3448,B00WBS31OQ,The bass will make it keep moving so that it will eventually keep falling off whatever you set it on. Plus when it falls the side will pop off and eventually break so that they won't stay on making it so the water can get inside.
7,Verizon MiFi 6620L Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot (Verizon Wireless),2333,"B0172DS3ME,B00NTJKAXG","I was surprised at how well my new MiFi 6620L works. It easily reaches 25 Mbps and I have great signal everywhere I go (except a few spots on my train commute into Washington, D.C.).Long battery life and solid signal make it a great device for remote work and internet use.I strongly recommend the 6620L for anyone who needs a portable internet solution in addition to data sharing on a cell phone plan."
8,JVC KD-X320BTS Apple iPod and Android Digital Media Receiver with Bluetooth,7373,B00R5WGT2E,"I wasn't really sure about this product, mostly because of the Bluetooth mic and how good it would be or not be, but I'm extremely impressed with it. I like how you can adjust the sensitivity of the mic. In my opinion, this was worth the money!"
9,"JBL - 6"" x 8"" 2-Way Coaxial Car Speakers with Polypropylene Cones (Pair) - Black",2668,B00V631478,Jbl speakers have great quality and sound for my vehicle
10,Lenovo - AC Adapter for Select Lenovo Yoga Laptops - Black,503,B009AEMB6I,My other laptop charger crapped out a while ago so I had to replace it. Works like a charm.
11,SiriusXM SXEZR1V1 XM Onyx EZR Satellite Radio Receiver with Vehicle Kit,9425,B06XSGYCHC,Perfection
12,PNY Anarchy 16GB Kit (2x8GB) DDR4 2400MHz (PC4-19200) CL15 Desktop Memory (BLUE) - MD16GK2D4240015AB,8417,B012ASF1WQ,Great ram to start building my new pc
13,Slingbox M2,1613,"B01LYGPB3J,B011QHAOWO","Purchased this in hopes that someone could set it up for me to record and watch NCAA Football games overseas when I travel. I did so despite reservations that Sling no longer provides support, updates, etc. Three competent people worked with me on it (a guy who installs cable for a major cable company, an IT prof for a large office, and a guy who works does audio/visual for a production studio). We couldn't get it to work - the slingbox could not recognize a cable box from Time Warner and multiple calls to Sling's support did not solve the problem.I used to use sling for several years and even used the hopper by dish with good success. Looks like they have fallen off in their support with all the competition. It is a shame because it is a great item for expats and people who travel internationally frequently - probably just to small a market share."
14,Sony SRSHG1/BLK Hi-Res Wireless Speaker- Charcoal black,17,"B01J0BFAAO,B019Q88VAM","This is one of the better Bluetooth speakers I have ever owned Considering the retail price versus what I paid for it Or use it along with my Amazon echo And the combination of the two Couldn't be better though the speaker would work as a standalone take to the beach, or anywhere in the house. The bass boost Is excellent The clarity and Fidelity is awesome as well Since I bought this I've had no desire to own another Bluetooth speaker."
15,"Midland Weather Alert Radio, 1.0 CT",5847,B004OVE61U,"This unit is well priced, and can be a lifesaver. Think hard about getting this item."
16,Sony Mini Digital Video Cassettes - DVC - 1 Hour,6602,B007QOIP3M,They work good on my camera it's a good make
17,SRS-ZR7 Wireless Speaker,3263,B01ETTL6LE,"I will start off by saying, I am using this speaker to play music in my office. The speaker sounds great at low volumes, but tends to distort and sound a little tinny at higher volumes. If this speaker were around $!50, it would probably be a 4 or 5 star for me, but for $300, I come to expect more. Fortunately, I got it open box so got a bit of a discount. The SongPal app is terrible as well."
18,Toshiba - 3TB Internal Serial ATA III Hard Drive for Desktops,3758,B009E6J1BU,"My husband installed it and computer couldn't find it and when he did get to it, the drive kept ejecting on him. Took it back and got and got a 5TB external hard drive. So much better."
19,"Power Acoustik - Gothic Series 10"" Dual-Voice-Coil 2-Ohm Subwoofer - Black",5640,B00B7C07LC,"Speaker hit and worked very well but didn't last too long, already burned out"
20,The Rebel BT On-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones (Black),3316,B01700RNIO,"Being from a Reggae based inspiration, these headphones are bass heavy, but being a bass player, I actually really like that. The rest of the sound spectrum is quite good. These are simply a great bargain if you don't mind a little extra clean bass. My only complaint is that the power indicator LED is quite dim and hard to see."
21,CRX-322 CD Receiver,723,B005YXXS4I,"My original title for this review: Extremely tiny. But does everything needed, and moreThe reviewers who complain that the product does not have Bass, Treble, and Balance controls have not read the manual, where the functions of the Option menu are detailed.A few months later, I am adding this to my review: I sure loved this little stereo, until I learned over time that the number of ordinary mass produced music CDs it can play is LESS than the number it cannot play. I have never before had a CD player that could not play ALL mass produced music CDs. More than half of the CDs I try, it makes several attempts to read them, then says Unknown disc and stops. The same CDs work in every other player I have."
22,"DreamWave - Tremor Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Green,Black",4820,B00U0VEGRM,The best I have bought has a good sound I listen all day and I hold the battery well
23,Alpine,9283,"B00Q397RJY,B005LKCDR2,B001447Z8Q","there have been a few occasions where this device would not connect using the usb cable, however, it definitely was worth the money and it works very very well. there have been only a few occasions where i had to unplug my iPhone and replug it in for the device to connect properly. but seriously, that was only a few times and it works great and i am happy with my purchase. the only thing about the interface that i do not like is that not all apps are comparable, such as Waze map app. Other than the occasional connection issue, which really hasn't been a problem, and the lack of full app support, I would have given this device 5 stars. I am VERY happy that my Slacker radio works! Apple maps work great and so does siri for use of the phone and iMessages!! I am very happy with this Alpine!"
24,XPS 8920 Tower Desktop Computer,8342,B06XVDYHQX,My husband love it it was a gift and perfect good product
25,Air-Fi Runaway AF32 Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Headphones with Hidden Microphone (White),5050,B008FH1PJA,"I love these headphones. At first, I bought a pair for my son. We were so impressed with the sound quality, that I went back and bought myself a pair."
26,SAMSUNG 40'' Class FHD (1080P) Smart LED TV (UN40M5300),7408,B071ZVQVFQ,This TV is such a great deal for the price. I love the clear picture and the Smart TV features.
27,NS-SP1800BL 5.1-Channel Home Theater System (Black),7880,B001AVRD62,Good size and good looking with great sound treble and base
28,Acoustimass 6 Series V Home Theater Speaker System (Black),8550,B00TVFO08S,"The Bose speakers are great. They work great and sound great. If you want a plug and play system, this is it."
29,Logitech G403 Wireless Gaming Mouse with High Performance Gaming Sensor,8736,B01KUAMCWI,"I like the mouse except that it has no warning when the battery is out of power or near out of power, it just stops working. I leave it plugged in when gaming."
30,Sony MEXM100BT 160W RMS Marine CD Receiver with Bluetooth (Black) and SiriusXM Ready,9970,B01CEAT9ZU,"Great sound, remote is great to have for use on boat. I don't have the glare issue that others have complained about"
31,Sony SRSXB30/BLK XB30 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth,629,"B01MUG578I,B072MP2CFG",Base does not change very much .Sound not full when out of the store
32,Sony LBT-GPX555 Mini-System with Bluetooth and NFC,5292,B00IWQ3YPC,
33,NS-IW480CWH In-Ceiling 8 Natural Sound Three-Way Speaker System (Pair),4460,B000O3TFWW,We plugged them into the system to give a try before installing. They sound good on rock n roll classics but for movies the sound was a little too muddy for me
34,Motorola Wi-Fi Pet Video Camera,4105,B00LIL7YVI,"I bought this obviously to watch my pets. One of them has been digging at some trim and I wanted to see who it was. I have witnessed the culprit and am able to talk with her to get her to stop. I have been using for 2 weeks now, almost daily. When I go to work is my main concern, but have tried even while out shopping, dining etc. The picture has always been crystal clear, however, it does switch between black and white and color. Not sure why but it's not a major issue for me. You can can hear them or mute them, speak with them, check on the room temperature, it has night vision that works in the complete darkness and still get a nice picture. They also will save the recordings for you for a small fee. They give 7 days free. My only dissatisfaction with this product is that you cannot raise the volume on the camera itself and I feel it's a little on the low side. I do know the dogs can hear me when I speak to them. There are 2 holes in the bottom to mount, but the way I would really like to mount it turns the camera upside down and the picture stays that way, it won't right itself. I'm satisfied with this little camera and has done what I need it to do. When I have to be away from the pups I can still check in on them and talk with them. It has actually put me at ease and given me a little peace of mind. I can see that they are doing well, have water, they are playing and most importantly that they are safe and peaceful. My boss made a good point today as well. The direction the camera faces happens to be my front door, so I can see if anyone breaks in or if there should be a fire or some dangerous situation, I will know in real time."
35,"AW6500 All-Weather Outdoor Speaker (White, Single)",8720,"B00170HCOO,B001BBT7RY,B00170O1HK","Great sound for my patio use, covers 400 Square feet!"
36,"Alpine - 6-1/2"" 2-Way Coaxial Car Speakers with Polypropylene Cones (Pair) - Black",2120,B0038NMC8O,These speakers really sound full and rich tones fits perfect.
37,Travel RockStar 3-in-1 2A USB and Dual-Outlet Wall Charger with Internal 3000mAh Battery Pack,7593,B01364B00K,"Ordered this for my nephew, it's exactly what he wanted and works as he expected. Best Buy even honored a price match."
38,Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wired Over Ear Headphones,2178,B00F6PRSMW,"I would actually give these 4 1/2 stars if I could. These are the best headphones I have ever heard from B&W, greatly improved from their closed in, overly warm earlier models. The P7 wireless still have a somewhat elevated bass, but control and slam in the bass region is excellent and the elevated bass does not muddy the excellent midrange. Highs are very good also. Imaging not a pinpoint as the Sennheiser Momentum wireless, but also very good. Superior bluetooth range, and interference when it does occur is not as ""busy"" as on the Momentums - instead of a series of dropouts and digi-noise as on the Senns, I usually only get a simple dropout of signal - much less annoying. Everything is improved a bit in wired mode, the bass is even better controlled, making them less warm while improving slam even more, midrange & highs also improve. Best ear pads ever - very deep and the foam forms a nice seal which is very effective for blocking outside noise (there is no Noise Cancelling in these as in the Momentums). Clamping force is very strong at first (which helps with the seal) which may be off-putting to some. These are excellent headphones, especially for Bluetooth headphones, but I find the Momentums a tad more refined and prefer them slightly to the P7. However, they are close enough in quality that it is a matter of taste I think, and many will prefer the B&W - you can't go wrong either way."
39,Everest Elite 700 Around-Ear Wireless Headphones (White),8282,B01AEW9E46,purchased as a gift and I've receiver perfect feedback from recipient
40,Clarity - Super-Loud Phone Ringer - White,4774,B00009WCBT,Much needed for my Mother in Law to hear when the phone rings
41,House of Marley EM-DH003-PS TTR Noise-Cancelling Over-Ear Headphones (Black),9131,B00RZYD51A,"Great headphones, very comfortable and sound great"
42,Toshiba Micro Component Speaker System: Wireless Bluetooth Speaker Sound System with FM,1861,B0742RMVQ8,Just what I was looking for my small workroom. Good sound but does not take up a lot of room. I can use it for both my cds and mp3 disks.
43,"Kicker 41IK5BT2V2 Amphitheater High-Performance Audio System with Bluetooth, Black",7968,B00L2EWRW2,"I love this product, and I was surprised at how much bass it kicks out. The Bluetooth feature is a plus"
44,Prime Three-Way Center Channel Speaker (Premium Black Ash),6007,B00PASUGTC,"Like everything that SVS makes, this is one terrific center channel. I recplaced an old Bose center channel and this just blows it away. Clear, crisp dialogue. A little bright when first used, however, once it is broken in with multiple soundtracks and 20-30 hours of use it settles right in. Just terrific."
45,2TB Red 5400 rpm SATA III 3.5 Internal NAS HDD,4073,B008JJLZ7G,"The Red series by Western Digital has been fantastic in my Media Server. I have 8 2 TB drives in it, and I have been running ZFS in a RAIDZ-2 configuration without a hitch for some months. Several of the drives have been in the server for over a year, and not a single error has occurred. Since they support TLER, these drives are great for RAID arrays (both software and hardware)."
46,Nighthawk AC1900 Dual-Band Wi-Fi USB Adapter,5223,B073JHHNJ9,I needed good reliable wifi adapter for my desktop pc and this works great.
47,Samsung Universal 3100mAh Portable External Battery Charger - White,9028,B00KGGK1J8,
48,Logitech 915-000224  Harmony Ultimate One 15-Device Universal Infrared Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control - Black,5823,B00IAKLM54,"Cannot hit play, FF or Rev, etc, without having your hand/arm over the touch pad which is VERY sensitive! The slightest brush can mess up what you are watching. I have to brace my forearm on the bottom part, keep my wrist bent up very high in order to use the playing options. Even then it's not a given it won't sense your arm over the top and change it to a different channel or activity. Also no way to use a number pad that I can find so have to grab another remote to do that. It's a nice idea but very flawed design. It would be much better to have the touch screen at the top at least, and a screen to go to that gives the number/alphabet option."
49,Round LCD/Projector Ceiling Plate - Black,7326,"B005MJHFHK,B00VXW0J5A,B00OY50CZU",This looks good on my celling. Flushes very well with the celling.
